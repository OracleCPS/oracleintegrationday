# Online Shopping Integration Flow Development

## Introduction

In this Lab we are going to take a sample integration flow and add additional components to finish the flow.

The OIC integration flow that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

---
## Objectives
Take sample integration flow and add 2 conditional branches and test.

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Login to your Oracle Cloud account

### Login to OIC Integration Home Page

>***NOTE:*** The **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. See _Lab 100 **1.1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account_ for more information on how to sign into the OIC home page.

### REST Connection

In this first part of the lab, we will reuse an existing connection:

Let’s start by logging into the Oracle Cloud account using your allocated user.   

**1.1** Click on **Integrations** tab followed by  the **Connection** section from designer page as shown below. 

![](images/200/img112.png)

![](images/200/img113.png) 

**1.2** We are already having a connection named "OnlineShoppingPaymentInvoke". We will use the same during our development.

![](images/300/image101a.png)

**1.3** Click on the **Integrations** link in the upper left to get back to the Integration page.

![](images/200/img088.PNG) 

### Clone and Develop your Integration

**2.1** You are already having an existing integration named **Online shopping Sample**. We will create a clone of the same integration.

**2.2** Search with above integration name as shown below. 

![](images/300/img102.PNG)

**2.3** Select the hamburger icon on the right and click **Clone** as shown below. 

![](images/300/img103.png)

**2.4** A new page comes up. Provide the integration name as **FirstnameLastname Online Shopping Sample Lab 300**, description if you wish to and click **Clone** button as shown in the below diagram.

![](images/300/img104.png)

**2.5** A new integration is created as shown below. 

![](images/300/img105.png)

_Now we will add two conditional branches in the same flow and test it out_

**2.6** Click on the newly selected integration and you will see an already existing workflow. Here we will add two conditional branches and test it out.

![](images/300/img106.png)

**2.7** Select **switch button** on left and click **+** as shown below 

![](images/300/img107.png)


**2.8** A new branch will be created as shown in the below diagram.

**2.11** Next we need to select the input parameter. Drill down and select **response** field and drop on empty box as shown below.

![](images/300/img111.png)

**2.12** Finally provide the expression parameter as shown below and click on **Validate** button. Your overall page should look like this. 

![](images/300/img112.png)

**2.13** Click **Close** button to come out of this wizard. Next, we need to map the output parameters. Select **Map** Data from Actions tab as shown.

![](images/300/img130.png)

![](images/300/img130_1.png)

**2.31** Now we are back to the Integration page, from here select **Return** action item as shown.

![](images/300/img131.png)

**2.32** Drag and drop to the same swimlane, your entire message flow should look like this.
![](images/300/img132.png)

**2.33** Next click on **Edit** button for response mapping as shown

![](images/300/img133.png)

![](images/300/img145_1.png)

**2.39** You will be redirected to a new page. Copy Endpoint URL and save it for later. You are going to use it in Postman for testing your request.

![](images/300/img145_2.png)

### Testing your Integrations (using Postman)

Testing the activated integration can be done using multiple tools and depends on your preference. See each relevant product's website on how to install the tool, if its required.

**3.1** Got to URL **chrome:/apps** in _Chrome_ and open POSTMAN

![](images/200/image066.png)

**3.2** Click on the Collection tab as shown below  

![](images/300/img146.png)

Provide the name for your collection as it shown below

![](images/300/img146_1.png)

Click on the AddRequest tab as shown below

![](images/300/img146_2.png)



**3.3** Here provide the name of the Integration and optional description and click **Save**

![](images/300/img147.png)

**3.4**A new page comes up. Click on **Authorization Tab**. For Authorization type, select Basic Auth. Provide the credentials that you used to sign in to Oracle Cloud.

![](images/300/img148.png)

**3.5** Next, we need to set the request. 1. Select POST method and copy paste the Endpoint URL that you saved earlier (from 1.39). 2. Click on **Body** section and update the request json as shown below. 

```json
{"OrderId": "1235", "UnitPrice": "10000", "NumberOfItems": "3", "ShippingState": "OH", "Model": "WalkeyTalkey 1.0", "ReturnReason": "Does Not Work"}
```

Make sure you select JSON(application/json) format (5)

![](images/300/img148_1.png)

**3.6** Click on Send button and check the response at bottom.

![](images/300/img150.png)

![](images/300/img137.png)

**3.7** Now go back to the Integration Page  and navigate  **Tracking** field as shown below 

![](images/300/img152.png)

![](images/300/img152_1.png)

![](images/300/img152_2.png)

**3.8** Click on the order instances as shown

![](images/300/img153_1.png)

**3.9** You will see the overall flow  of the integration as shown 

![](images/300/img154_1.png)

You have now completed Lab 300 of the OIC Developer Workshop. In the next lab, we are going to create a User Interface using ABCS, then call the REST API with online shopping request.

- This Lab is now completed.

### Testing your Integrations (using Restlet Client)

If you do not have Postman installed, another option to test the activated integration is through Restlet Client add-on in the browser.

**4.0** Open the browser where Restlet Client add-on is installed. Click on the purple icon with ‘R’ on it

![](images/300/restlet_icon.png)

**4.1** Restlet Client will open in the browser as shown below

![](images/300/restlet_client_page.png)

**4.2** In the ‘Method’ dropdown select ‘POST’. Enter the integration Endpoint URL that you saved earlier (from 1.39) in the textbox next to dropdown as shown below.

![](images/300/add_endpoint_url.png)

**4.3** If the Content-Type is not already set to ‘application/json’ under the Headers section as shown below then add new header ‘Content-Type’ and set it to ‘application/json’

![](images/300/add_contenttype.png)

**4.4** Click on ‘Add Authorization’ link under the Headers section next to ‘Add Headers’ button to add basic authorization details

**4.9** You will see the overall flow  of the integration as shown 

![](images/300/img154_1.png)

You have now completed Lab 300 of the OIC Developer Workshop. In the next lab, we are going to create a User Interface using ABCS, then call the REST API with online shopping request.
