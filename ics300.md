# Online Shopping Integration Flow Development

---

## Introduction

In this Lab we are going to take a sample integration flow and add additional components to finish the flow.

The OIC integration flow that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

## Objectives
Take sample integration flow and add 2 conditional branches and test.

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Login to your Oracle Cloud account

### Login to OIC Integration Home Page

>***NOTE:*** Cloud Account Credentials including **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. 
---

**1.1** From your browser (Firefox or Chrome recommended) go to the following URL:
<https://cloud.oracle.com>

**1.2** Click _Sign In_ in the upper right hand corner of the browser
**IMPORTANT** - Make sure `Cloud Account with Identity Cloud Service` is selected Under Cloud Account, Enter **Cloud Account Name** provided by your instructor and Click on `Next >` 

![](images/300/image001a.png)

**1.3** Enter your `User Name` and `Password` and click **Sign In**

***NOTE:*** the **User Name and Password** values will be given to you by your instructor.

![](images/300/image002a.png)  

**1.4** You will be presented with a Dashboard displaying the various cloud services available to this account.

**NOTE:** The Cloud Services dashboard is intended to be used by the *Cloud Administrator* user role.  The Cloud Administrator is responsible for adding users, service instances, and monitoring usage of the Oracle cloud service account.  Developers and Operations roles will go directly to the service console link, not through the service dashboard.

![](images/300/image003a.png)

**1.5** The Service Administrator can also look at Billing and Monitoring MetrAIC to understand how the service is being consumed by your Enterprise

![](images/300/image004.png)

**1.6** Selecting `View Details` link will take you to the Service Overview page where there are links for Billing and Monitoring Services. As this is a demonstration account, there is no Billing and Monitorin information available.

![](images/300/image004ea.png)

**1.7**  To get to Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) service console where you will work on developing the integration, click on the `Open Service Console`. This will display OIC Service Instance Page listing all OIC Services provisioned in the Cloud Account.

![](images/300/image004ae.png)

**1.8**  Click on Hamburger menu for OIC Instance `<Instance Name>` and Select the `Open Integration Cloud Home Page` link to go to the OIC Welcome Page.

### Clone and Develop your Integration

**2.1** You are already having an existing integration named **Online shopping Sample**. We will create a clone of the same integration.

**2.2** Search with above integration name as shown below. 

![](images/300/img102.PNG)

**2.3** Select the hamburger icon on the right and click **Clone** as shown below. 

![](images/300/img103.png)

**2.4** A new page comes up. Provide the integration name as **FirstnameLastname Online Shopping Sample Lab 300**, description if you wish to and click **Clone** button as shown in the below diagram.

![](images/300/img104.png)

**2.5** A new integration is created as shown below. 

![](images/300/img105.PNG)

_Now we will add two conditional branches in the same flow and test it out_

**2.6** Click on the newly selected integration and you will see an already existing workflow. Here we will add two conditional branches and test it out.

![](images/300/img106.png)

**2.7** Select **switch button** on left and click **+** as shown below 

![](images/300/img107.png)


**2.8** A new branch will be created as shown in the below diagram.

### Online Shopping Integration Testing

Testing the activated integration can be done using multiple tools and depends on your preference. See each relevant product's website on how to install the tool, if its required.

### Testing your Integrations using Postman

Follow these instructions to test the integration using Postman.

**3.1** Got to URL **chrome:/apps** in _Chrome_ and open POSTMAN

**3.3** Here provide the name of the Integration and optional description and click **Save**

![](images/300/img147.PNG)

**3.4**A new page comes up. Click on **Authorization Tab**. For Authorization type, select Basic Auth. Provide the credentials that you used to sign in to Oracle Cloud.

![](images/300/img148.png)

**3.5** Next, we need to set the request. 1. Select POST method and copy paste the Endpoint URL that you saved earlier (from 1.39). 2. Click on **Body** section and update the request json as shown below. 

```json
{"OrderId": "1235", "UnitPrice": "10000", "NumberOfItems": "3", "ShippingState": "OH", "Model": "WalkeyTalkey 1.0", "ReturnReason": "Does Not Work"}
```

Make sure you select JSON(application/json) format (5)
