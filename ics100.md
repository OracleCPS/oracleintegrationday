### Online Shopping Integration Testing

Testing the activated integration can be done using multiple tools and depends on your preference. See each relevant product's website on how to install the tool, if its required.

#### Testing your Integrations using Postman

Follow these instructions to test the integration using Postman.

**3.1** Got to URL **chrome:/apps** in _Chrome_ and open POSTMAN

![](images/200/image066.PNG)

**3.2** Click on the Collection tab as shown below

**3.5** Next, we need to set the request. 1. Select POST method and copy paste the Endpoint URL that you saved earlier (from 1.39). 2. Click on **Body** section and update the request json as shown below. 

```json
{"OrderId": "1235", "UnitPrice": "10000", "NumberOfItems": "3", "ShippingState": "OH", "Model": "WalkeyTalkey 1.0", "ReturnReason": "Does Not Work"}

**4.7** Now go back to the Integration Page  and navigate  **Tracking** field as shown below 

![](images/300/img152.png)

![](images/300/img152_1.png)

![](images/300/img152_2.png)

**4.8** Click on the order instances as shown

![](images/300/img153_1.png)

**4.9** You will see the overall flow  of the integration as shown 

![](images/300/img154_1.png)

You have now completed hands-on lab setup, In the next lab, we are going to take a sample integration flow and add additional components to finish the flow.

- This Lab is now completed.
